    "• Allows analysts to manipulate and process data quickly without automated pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ Key Steps for Ad Hoc ETL with SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Extract Data 🛠️\n",
    "• Pull relevant sales data from source tables\n",
    "-- Example:\n",
    "SELECT order_id, customer_id, product_id, sale_date, sales_amount\n",
    "FROM sales_data\n",
    "WHERE sale_date >= '2025-01-01';\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Transform Data 🔄\n",
    "• Clean, filter, aggregate, or calculate new fields\n",
    "-- Examples:\n",
    "-- Calculate monthly sales per product\n",
    "SELECT product_id,\n",
    "       DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month,\n",
    "       SUM(sales_amount) AS monthly_sales\n",
    "FROM sales_data\n",
    "GROUP BY product_id, month;\n",
    "\n",
