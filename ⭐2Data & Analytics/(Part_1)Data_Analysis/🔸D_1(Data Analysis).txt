⭐ What is Data Analysis? 

🔸 Purpose:  

🔸 Related Topics & Some Examples (past data check and future prediction + imagination future features): 
🔸 Predict customer behavior 
🔸 Create homogeneous cluster (classification & regression) 
🔸 Graphs and visualization 

🔸 All centuries Data Analysis (all field analysis important) requirements & Data Scientist link: 

🔸 Why Data Analysis important (business growth: past and future + example of business how to work for growth): 

⭐ Check customer requirements + timing + interest check + check budgets + 360-degree viewing + check customer satisfaction level + feedbacks + bad feedbacks customer gift provide strategies 

⭐ Management Perspective (data check + customer understanding + present time trends check + growth check income + extract relevant information + help of dashboard) 

⭐ Limitation of Analyst (need for machine learning tools + examples of why analyst is limited + reasons for machine learning next step) 

⭐ Data Analysis Tools
(help analysis understand data: R, SQL, Python, SAS, Power BI, Spark, K9, Excel, Splunk, OpenRefine, Jenkins)
- Different companies use different methods and tools
- Categories: Important, 50% Important, Optional 

⭐ Types of Data Analysis - Data Prospect
- Qualitative (cannot be measured data) 
- Quantitative (can be measured data, text-based) 

⭐ Types Of Analysis Techniques
- Statistical
  - Descriptive (already happened)
  - Inferential (different sample collection for prediction)
  - Exploratory (find connections + hypotheses)
  - Diagnostic (focus on "why", prediction analysis)
  - Perspective Analysis
  - Recommender Analysis (suggestions for future problems)
  - Text Analysis 

⭐ Statistical Analysis
- Dashboard creation, graphs, models of data, customer data analysis
- Descriptive: summarize all data (numerical & categorical, full population)
- Inferential: sample data (e.g., 30% of population)
- Exploratory: store relationships/connections 

⭐ Diagnostic Analysis
- Graphs check reason for growth/loss
- Why did it happen? Identify issues
- Solve problems using past data 

⭐ Predictive Analysis
- Predict what is likely to happen
- Check budgets and reasons for buying (season, salary, etc.)
- Use past data, diagnostic and descriptive results
- ML/AI for future trends & problem prediction
- Forecasting examples: temperature, rainfall, population
- Accuracy depends on data 

⭐ Prescriptive Analysis
- Combine prediction data & decide actions
- Key areas: marketing, sales, customer experience, HR, finance, logistics 

⭐ Text Analysis
- Document comparison, check duplications, feedbacks
- Text mining for large data
- Sentiment analysis, topic identification, mood/tree analysis, toxic words
- Word-based analysis (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
- Survey responses, pain points, communication setup 

⭐ Techniques & Methods
1. Cluster Analysis (patterns, growth)
2. Cohort Analysis (behavior of customer groups)
3. Regression Analysis (numerical & categorical)
4. Factor Analysis (variable importance)
5. Neural Networks (pattern recognition, AI)
6. Data Mining (exploring patterns & relations)
7. Text Analysis
8. Time Series (signal trends)
9. Decision Tree (final decision making)
10. Conjoint Analysis (survey-based insights) 

⭐ Cluster Analysis
- Explore data patterns
- Homogeneous (similar) vs Heterogeneous (different) clusters
- Business perspective: sales, marketing, insurance, geology 

⭐ Cohort Analysis
- Subset behavior analysis
- Divide groups (example Gmail: spam vs important)
- Market analysis: online/offline purchasing trends 

⭐ Regression Analysis
- Dependent/independent variable analysis
- Linear & non-linear regression
- Identify patterns for past & future predictions 

⭐ Factor Analysis
- Dimension reduction
- Identify hidden patterns
- Summarize variables based on correlation & covariance 

⭐ Neural Networks
- Input → Hidden → Output
- Multi-layer networks
- Applications: image recognition, handwriting, speech, signals, language, object recognition, AI generation, stock prediction, text classification 

⭐ Data Mining
- Explore relations, patterns, trends
- Example: KPIs, intelligent alerts 

⭐ Text Analytics / Text Mining
- Statistics, ML, AI, computer science applications 

⭐ Time Series Analytics
- Track trends, seasonality, cyclic patterns
- Forecast business & operational data 

⭐ Decision Trees
- Flowchart-based analysis
- Example: Weather → Actions → Outcomes 

⭐ Conjoint Analysis
- Identify customer needs & response to features
- Example: Haircare products strategy
